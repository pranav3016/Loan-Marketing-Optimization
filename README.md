# Bank Loan Marketing Optimization Engine

## Introduction
This ReadMe file provides a detailed guide for using a Python script to analyze and build predictive models for a bank marketing campaign dataset. The dataset contains information about the marketing campaign conducted by a bank and the responses of clients to subscribe to a term deposit.

## Project Motivation
Term deposits serve as a key revenue stream for banks, representing cash investments with fixed interest rates over a specified term. To promote these deposits, banks employ diverse outreach strategies, including telephonic marketing. Despite its effectiveness, telephonic campaigns require substantial resources. This project aims to predict client subscriptions to term deposits, enhancing the efficiency of telephonic marketing by targeting potential subscribers more strategically.

Using data from phone-based marketing campaigns by a Portuguese bank, the project focuses on building a classification model. This model predicts whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit, empowering the bank to optimize telephonic efforts by prioritizing individuals with a higher likelihood of engagement.

The key steps covered in this analysis include **Data Preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and Building Models** to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit. The Python script utilizes various libraries, including pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, Pandas Profiling Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, Decision Tree, and LightGBM. for data analysis and model building.
